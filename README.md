Bowser
======

A WebRTC browser for iOS developed in the open

Bowser is based on the official UIWebView provided by the platform and the WebRTC API's are implemented with JavaScript that is injected into web pages as they load, the injected JavaScript code is using remote procedure calls to control the OpenWebRTC backend.

Mobile Safari on iPhone typically displays <video> elements only in fullscreen. This severely limits the UI of your apps, especially when designing video communication apps using WebRTC. Bowser goes beyond that and allows you to fully customise and manipulate <video> elements using CSS and JavaScript.
